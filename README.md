# Scientific Calculator
In this repo, you'll find a basic calculator. I'll use object oriented programing to resolving it

Note
## Windows users:
- You can run the program from the terminal.

## Linux Users:
- Install Xming and initialize
- Execute 'export DISPLAY=:0.0' in the terminal
- Call the program in the terminal --> python3 calculator.py
